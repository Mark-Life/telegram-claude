# Edit last prompt via reply

> Mark-Life/telegram-claude#26

## Problem
No way to edit and re-send a prompt. User must retype the entire message.

## Proposal
- Allow user to reply to their own previous message to re-send an edited version of that prompt
- The re-sent prompt should use the same session context
- Could also add an inline "Retry" button on the bot's response for quick re-runs
