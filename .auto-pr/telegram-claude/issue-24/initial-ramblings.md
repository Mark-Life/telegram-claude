# Branch/PR awareness in project status

> Mark-Life/telegram-claude#24

## Problem
No visibility into the current git branch or PR status from within Telegram.

## Proposal
- Show current git branch in project status / pinned message
- Add `/pr` command to list open PRs for the active project
- Add `/branch` command to show or switch branches
- Optionally show branch info in the response footer alongside cost/duration
